simple app with two views

view number 1:
there are two input fields with validators: number field should be only digits, message field should not be longer than 250 characters.
on "SEND MESSAGE" you will be navigated to another view with similar design.

view number 2:
on this view there are text fields instead of inputs. design is slightly different.
on "Clear" click texts will be cleared.
